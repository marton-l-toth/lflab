lflab is free software with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY:
==> about
A short overview of GUI elements, and of audio config:
==> etc.gui (general)
==> etc.audio
The two windows already open:
==> win.main
==> win.tree
"!e" stands for "examples". The items 1,2,... are clipboards
double click (on the number not the arrow) to open them.
==> etc.!b and !e
==> win.clipboard
On the clipboards, left clk. plays (&stops when clicked again),
but each of these sounds is just a single representative of an
instrument which can be opened with right click for playing.
==> win.instrument(play)
There is help for most windows (a "?" button or in a menu "+").
The examples in "!e" are read-only but you can make copies
or create new objects. (Sounds/instruments can be quickly
copied with a middle-click (e.g. on the play grid), other
objects can only be created in the tree view window.
-----
If you make new instruments/tracks/components, save them with
the "save" button. (or if you exit you can "autosave")
THERE IS NO UNDO, SAVE OFTEN!!!
==> etc.save files
{{{?._dtre}}}
Without any save files, you start with the "!b", "!c" subtree,
and (unless you started with the "-n" option) the "!e" subtree.
In "!b" you have the default clipboard "[]", help texts like
this one under "?", and various builtin boxes. You can open
a description for each builtin box by double-clicking them.
"!c" is reserved for contributions, see c/zB.c for details.
In "!e" the numbered items 1,2,... are clipboards (double-click
on the name(number) to open window), which contain instruments.
These instruments use builtin boxes and editable (to be exact,
copiable, then editable) boxes from "!e.box".
Example boxes are grouped as follows:
echo : combinations of simple echo filters
fb : simple examples for feedback
fe : string/membrane wrappers for the finite-elem builtin "=fe"
filt : some simple compound filters
hpar : combination (almost iteration) of parallel p/z filters
nz : noise-based boxes
osc : simple applications of non-linear (rev.quad.) oscillator
sel : some filter config using selector boxes
wave : waves modulated by other waves
{{{?._boxg}}}
A box is a little machine with 0...30 input ports and 1...30
output ports, each of which receives/sends 44100 real(64-bit)
numbers per second. From simple builtin boxes you can build
more complicated ones, and ultimately wrap them in an
instrument configuration to be able to conveniently select
their inputs and hear their outputs.
-----
Most non-filter boxes can accept constant or variable input on
all input ports (except "phs" for waves "~xyz"), and most 
filters "=xyz" can take variable input only on the first input
port. Exceptions to this are mentioned in the description of
builtin boxes. "Not accepted" variable input does not result
in an explicit "error", only most of the input is ignored
(except the first sample, or in some cases the first sample
in each time-slice).
-----
Editable boxes can be graphs, calculators or tracks.
==> win.graph-box
==> win.calc-box
==> win.track
Browse "!b" and "!e" for primitive boxes and examples of
editable boxes.
==> etc.!b and !e
{{{?._file}}}
THERE IS NO UNDO, SAVE OFTEN!!!
You can get a list of command line options by "lf -?"
There are two kinds of save files: normal & library.
If you start the program with a list of files, the last will
be read as a normal save file, the others as libraries.
This can be changed by including "/" in the file list,
then only files before the "/" are libraries -- in this case
when you save the normal files are merged into a single file.
Object in a library are read only.
"save" button in main window saves the whole tree
(except read-only objects) to a normal save file.
on exit (with autosave) a file "__autosave" is written
"save(L)" & "save(R)" save the (left/right) selected directory
to a library. (you can always load libraries as normal files
for editing, but you can't load normal files as libraries).
5 backup versions are kept for save & autosave files.
(file--1, file--2, ... file--5)
Currently there is no "load file" option so you have to 
restart the program to load another file.
THERE IS NO UNDO, SAVE OFTEN!!!
{{{?._wma}}}
main window:
kussb+ - kill all sounds (not the same as mute, cf. below)
unplot - restarts gnuplot (closes all plot windows)
LR - displays (on top) tree window
++ - main menu (here you can open the console, show the
pole-zero diagram for the last filter, and exit)
save - save file (name can be changed in tree window)
rec - start/stop recording (see auconv link below)
CPU meter: green-OK, yellow-high load, red-danger grey-muted
CPU meter should run about 1 dashed line / sec, depending
on the speed setting.
(if stopped or very fast then something doesn't work...)
---
Mute mode: Ctrl+right-click on CPU meter (grey when muted)
In mute mode the audio device is closed, so other programs
can use it (but close them before "unmuting"), sounds/boxes
are not stopped, recording (if on) continues.
==> etc.audio
==> win.tree
==> win.auconv
{{{?._au}}}
In the current version there is no window for audio config,
you can set them from the command line (-? for help) or by 
editing the lf.ini file (in .lf under you home dir.)
(If you have a config (from command line) that works well,
you can select "save config" from the main menu, and the 
current settings will be written to "lf.ini".)
---
Device name (-anm) can be "default", it typically means
a software mixer. (more applications can use it at the same
time, but can have large delays, and "interesting" clock
behaviour, so it is highly recommended to switch to a hardware
device.)
Hardware devices ("hw:0", "hw:1", "hw:0,1" "plughw:0" ...)
are opened for exclusive use (*), and they are faster.
The optimal setting for speed (-asp), clock type (-aclk)
and reserve buffer size (-arsrv) depend on your soundcard,
machine speed, and even kernel scheduler settings.
Typically "-aclk 2" is good for software mixers and "-aclk 0"
is good for hardware devices.
(*) when you turn on "mute mode" (ctrl+right-click on CPU
meter), the device is released so other programs can use it.
---
If you see the message "failed to start audio", please see
the console for detailed error messages:
- "unknown PCM" means the device name (-anm) is invalid
- "device or resurce busy" means that an other program is
using the hardware device
{{{?._wtr}}}
Tree view: here you can browse and edit the object tree.
(The same tree is visible on the left and right side.)
The object tree can contain the following types of objects:
folders (see below), intruments, boxes and clipboards.
==> win.instrument(cfg)
==> win.clipboard
==> etc.box (general)
A folder can contain up to 32 named objects (of any type).
Name: up to 20 ASCII characters except dot(.) and dollar sign.
(up to 20 ASCII characters except dot(.) and dollar sign)
Folders can be opened by double-clicking on the name or
clicking on the little arrow. (clipboards can also be opened
as folders (arrow) but in most cases it is more convenient to
open their own window (double-click).
On the top, you can change the file name or save to library.
==> etc.save files
On the bottom, there are buttons for rename/local copy/
copy/move/del and a create object menu button. The text field
above the buttons is used for all these operations.
(for copy/move set the text on the "from" side). 
---
Object selection (in instrument config window or graph window):
3 menu buttons ('[' '*' ']'), with which a list of left
selected folder, shortlist, and right sel. f. can be opened.
(Open/reload/edit an object to add it to the shortlist.)
{{{?._gui}}}
Gui -- general description
Cyan (like "save" on main win.) -- simple button
Yellow (like "++" on main win.) -- menu button
Green number + grey label (like vol. on main win.) -- counter
On counters, left click increments, right clicks decrements.
For some counters, shift+click and ctrl+click incr/decr more.
(not all counters have an attached slider)
For most menu buttons left & right click have the same effect,
but for menus where the first item is in [brackets], left
click activates the first item, without opening the menu.
Text fields (like file name in top line of tree view window)
are standard text fields, with usual copy & paste functions.
---
When strange things happen, it can be helpful to open the
console (from main win./++ menu) because the information
there is much more detailed then in the "Errors" window.
{{{?._plan}}}
Planned features (please don't take these as promises :) )
- window for audio config
- import of external audio
- improved track editor usability (drag & drop?)
- default values for boxes
- description for non-builtin boxes
- plot/save/record to backgr. job (like autovol calc.)
- RPM package
- user input for running sounds (perhaps with some MIDI HW)
- more builtin boxes and example editable boxes
{{{?._wwp}}}
Small button on the left, below (or between) the sliders:
left-click: focus (keyboard) on grid, right-click: menu
--- MOUSE ---
L: default action (set in config window, play in clik mode)
Sh-L: toggle (or play in tggl mode)
Ctrl-L: play unique (or play in uniq mode)
M: copy
Sh-M: copy to current track
R: set (config window is updated)
Sh-R: set but keep constants
Ctrl-R: kill
Release L: stop (hold mode) otherwise no effect
--- KEYS ---
If keys are configured, they are visible in the grid.
(unless the window is very small)
A key press (release) has the same effect as left click (rel.)
Use the ESC key to enter / leave key edit mode.
In key edit mode a purple box cursor is visible.
Left-click to select square, mid-click to delete key,
press (non-ESC) key to assign.
{{{?._wgr}}}
At a time you can have one selected input (blue), a selected
output (red) and a selected box (purple).
(external input counts as output, and vice versa)
Top toolbar: number of inputs, output, feedback (see below),
reserved (later, there will be a 'replace' mode), box select
(left/sl/right, see tree view for obj selection),
connect (sel. output to sel. input), set value (sel. input)
remove (selected box), and shuffle.
Every input has either a constant value (== button), or
is connected to an output (or external input) (---> button).
Shuffle does not work for all graphs (and sometimes it only
changes the serial nr. of boxes not the layout).
Because graph layout is calculated by an external program
(graphviz/dot, many thanks to its developers!), after every
new/deleted connection the graph is redrawn.
Feedback: The delay (!i) is expected to be a >0 constant.
The special output >i comes back to the special input <i
with !i delay. (when delay goes below 0.01 (10ms), CPU
usage will increase rapidly).
==> win.tree
{{{?._wcc}}}
Calculator boxes are stateless boxes (each set of outputs only
depends on the current set of inputs, not previous ones),
defined by arithmetic expressions. A calc-box can have 0...30
inputs, 0..30 temporary variables and 1...30 outputs.
Temporary variables can be calculated using the inputs and
previous temporary variables. Output values can be calculated 
using inputs, temporaries and previous outputs.
-----
In the top line you can set the number of inputs/tmps/outputs.
There is a line for each temporary/output: as you edit the
expression, the status (right) follows; a white-on-green "+"
means OK, while white-on-red means error:
"(" - syntax error 
"x" - non-existing input
"y"/"z" - non-existing or out-of-order tmp/output
"f" - non-existing function
"<" - too few arguments to function
">" - too many arguments to function
----
Currently only operators +,-,*,/,^(power) and the conditional
if<(a,b,c,d) (if a<b then c else d) are supported.
{{{?._wtk}}}
right now, the track editor is very simple, so the recommended
way is to write individual sounds (or perhaps simple loops) to
.wav files, and use a more full-featured tracker to compose
your 4-hour opera :)
---
a more complete description (along with more feautures) will
come in later versions, right now some of the non-trivial bits:
"rec" is for recording to this track at current position
"ali" is align clicks to dividing lines (and not pixels)
at the top right you can set pixel/beat and default values for
divisor/subdivisor
there is a context menu at the top/bottom of each column, where
you can play/loop a part of the track
---
every track can be used as a box (in graphs or instruments),
with BPM and from-to-repeat as input (BPM can be non-constant)
{{{?._wwcg}}}
This help text describes the top part (above "vol/envlp/LR") of
the instrument config window. In the top left corner, you can
set the play mode (clik/hold/tggl/uniq), described here:
==> win.instrument(play)
"stp" stops, "kill" stops sounds without "down" section
clicking on the 6-char-icon plays the selected sound
Right-click on the mini-grid opens the play window, left-click
is the same as a left-click on the grid in the play window.
---
You can display the output using gnuplot (many thanks to its
developers!) in a specified time interval, and also the
frequency spectrum (FFT) in a time interval and freq. range.
---
The four labels below the plot parameters select the config
line below them: [#] is grid dimensions config, "cfg" is 
currently defunct, for "av" and "wav" see:
==> win.icfg.autovol
==> win.auconv
Note: changing grid dimensions can change the selected sound
(known bug: left col. in scl.grps. is not updated in this case)
{{{?._wwav}}}
When using source/filter pairs with a wide range of inputs,
the output volume can vary greatly. The automatic volume
calibration makes convenient playback of such configurations
possible. The volume is computed on a (per default) 9x9x9x9
hypercube grid, and interpolated (on log.scale) on positions
between. The four dimensions are x, y (grid) and the first
two sliders. Per default, s5 is L/R and s6 is (manual, mul. by
autovol) volume, so if you use s3 and s4 you should only
configure inputs for them which do not significantly alter the
output volume. "t" is time in seconds, "r" is repeat (for boxes
involving noise, currently buggy so leave it 1).
The button "calc" starts the calculation. (right-clk stops).
The calculation goes left-to-right, so (assuming x=9) when it 
reaches 11.2%, the first column is already playable.
(known bug: sometimes the progress bar is stuck at 99.x%, but
it is only a GUI error, the calculation is actually finishes)
{{{?._wwc}}}
An instrument/sound is a wrapper object which makes boxes
playable. You can give constant (DC) inputs to a source box and
an optional filter box. These inputs can be either fixed or
selectable from a (linear/logarithmic/quadratic etc.) interval
using grid click x and y coordinates and some (max.6) sliders.
In addition to the box inputs, you can set duration, simple
enveloping, volume, and L/R balance.
---
This object is called "instrument/sound" because from every
single sound the whole instr. config can be edited, and every
instrument config has a specific "selected" sound (marked by
an "X" on the play grid, and specified by the first column of
the scale groups.)
---
As you may have noticed, this window is somewhat complicated,
so the description is broken to several parts:
==> win.icfg.general(top)
==> win.icfg.autovol
==> win.icfg.scale lines
==> win.icfg.scale groups
{{{?._wwsg}}}
Open/close scale groups with the "<>" / "><" buttons (right)
---volume/envlp(grp 1)---
"/*" and "\*" menu buttons set the shape of the "up" and "down"
sections of the enveloping function (for the source box):
(L)inear, (Q)uadratic, (E)xponential, (G)aussian, (S)igmoid, 
(-)None (up only), (A)utomatic (down only). Their length 
(except for "A") is given by "up" and "dn/l" in seconds.
The down section starts after "wait" seconds. (counted from the
start, not the end of "up" -- so if "wait"<"up" then the two
sections overlap and are multiplied). 
Auto mode "A": the src box ends when output is under the limit
"dn/l" for "wait" seconds. Filters are always in auto mode,
ending when under "Flim" for "Fwt" seconds.
Volume is vol1*vol2 (in most cases vol2 is fixed at 1.0)
LR: left-right balance (-1:left 0:center 1:right)
HINT1: with small up/wait/down values you can create simple
impulses (with src=!b.misc.copy) or "contaminated" impulses
(with src=!e.box.nz.nz01) of various shapes.
HINT2: you can easily visualise enveloping functions with
gnuplot (source box:"!b.misc.copy", x=1, filter:none) --
the copy box outputs constant 1, so you only see the evp.func.
---src/filter (grp 2/3)---
You can select source/filter box from the object tree with the
3 menu buttons ([, S/F and ]), as described here (bottom of pg)
==> win.tree
The values are the inputs of the source and filter boxes.
The first (0th) input of the filter box is not configurable,
since it is connected to the output of the source box.
{{{?._wwsl}}}
In every scale line, there are 3 entry fields (for numbers),
and 3 menu buttons.
The first field is for constant value -- if the scale (see
below) is set to "con" it is always effective, otherwise it
is ignored on (grid) left click and overwritten on right clk.
The 2 other fields (sep. by "...") are the from-to values.
The first menu button select the source (x,y grid coord. or
one of the sliders; ignored when scale is "con" or "cn1").
The second one sets the scale: linear, logarithmic, quadratic,
cubic, harmonic (1/x), reverse quad. and reverse cubic.
"con" means that the first col. is never changed, "cn1" means
that the value is the "from" value (ignoring "to" and source)
---
With the last button you can set one value (typically a freq.)
as reference value "=", and can multiply "*" or divide "/"
other values (typically frqs and impulse lengths) by it.
(If you want more complicated relations between inputs, create
a graph box with builtin arithmetic or calculator boxes.)
{{{?._wcl}}}
A clipboard is a container for at most 32 instrument objects.
Besides providing a convenient collection, it also serves as a
source/target for copy/paste operations. 
"cp" - toggle copy target (*)
"ps" - toggle paste source (*)
"2x" - allow to create duplicated with copy
"au" - play when left-clicked (to select)
"xc" - exchange on right-click
"re" - redraw
"+"  - menu (you can delete objects here)
(*) at any time, there is one source clipboard and one target
clipboard; at start both are set to the default clipb. "!b.[]"
---
left-cl:sel, right-cl:open(play) ctrl+right-cl:open(cfg)
middle-click: copy
keybindings for instruments also work from this window
(first selected obj, then sel. row, then next row etc.)
{{{?._wacv}}}
Audio files are first written to a 20-bit binary file.
This window provides a shortcut to convert the whole file
to .wav or .flac (if flac is installed), or delete it.
The result file will be placed to your home dir. (~), the
current dir. (.) or the temporary dir. (t) where the .a20
file is located. On successful conversion, the .a20 file
is deleted, and the audio convert window is closed.
-----
"Keep" simply closes this window, and you can convert the .a20
file (or intervals from it) with the program "lf.acv" later.
Run lf.acv without arguments to see a short description.
-----
The temporary directory is the LF_TMPROOT env. variable when  
defined, otherwise /run/shm (if exists) or /tmp.
/run/shm is a ramdisk filesystem, it won't survive a reboot!
Save the audio files worth keeping to a permanent place
(e.g. you home directory)
-----
There are two ways to write audio:
- "rec" (main window)  starts/ends a (stereo) recording
(unless tmp dir. is a ramdisk, this can cause serious slowdown)
- "wav" tab / "write" in instrument config window
here you can select mono/stereo and from-to/full duration
(from-to means the interval given for plot(t) (top right))
-----
HINT: if you are using a hardware audio device (which is
recommended for good response time), you can use the "mute"
function (ctrl-right click on the CPU meter, main window),
which releases the audio device, allowing you can listen to the
.wav/.flac file with an external program.
{{{?._werr}}}
With the controls on the top, you can clear the list, set the
number of messages, turn "annoying" (raising the message window
on new error, but at most once per second) on and off, and
opening the console.
-----
The console has much more detailed information than the error
message window, take a look when strange things are happening.
==> reporting bugs
{{{?._rbug}}}
Please send the following:
- precise instructions how to reproduce the error
- a save file with which the error is reproducible
- log (lf.log in <your_homedir>/.lf)
- lf.tlog (run "write tlog" from main menu)
- type of your sound card
- core file if any (see file /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern,
if it looks like a file name pattern you can easily find the
core file, if not then you have some automatic core-file
collecting system, see its documentation to find the core)
----
Not all of the above are absolutely necessary, but the more
you send, the greater the chance that the bug will be fixed.
