lflab-0.9-0-amd64.deb   : Debian 7 on Dell I17R, ALC283, MAYA44USB
lflab-0.9-0-i386.deb	: Linux Mint 17.3 (VirtualBox), virtual HW dev.
lflab-0.9-0.x86_64.rpm  : openSUSE Leap 42.1 (VirtualBox), PulseAudio
lflab-0.9-0.i686.rpm    : Fedora 23 (VirtualBox), PulseAudio
MIDI input was tested using KORG devices on Dell nb. and a Debian 8 desktop.
The semi-auto test on VMs only have a testcase for virtual MIDI device.

Features:
- generic MIDI input device support (see help for details)
- short description for boxes/clipboards, text-only objects in tree
- graph editor: replace box (on/off button)
- plotting (w. gnuplot): zoom, toggle graphs; FFT speedup
- new arithmetic (stateless) boxes
- new quick time-varying filters (.!b.filt.v)
- histogram box (for statistics e.g. noise distribution)
- constant non-integer delay filter (1st ord. allpass)
- track editor: "play" repeats last play/loop cmd.
- audio/clock: pump mode (for SW mixers esp. PulseAudio)
- audio/clock: more config options, more detailed logs
- various cpu usage/stability improvements
- more examples, description for some examples

Fixes:
- eliminate unnecessary autosaves
- all config (except devel/test) visible/changeable on GUI
- graph editor: feedback conn. kept when # of inputs increased
- graph editor: check to prevent adding of invalid objects
- iterated filter: fix for scale/multiply mode
- equalizer filter: fix for amp=+-1.0
- shadow wrap: fix random int-mode bitvec. when copying
- a lot of "crash" and "fails to redraw" bugfixes

Known problems:
- still no tree-delete
- no versioning for lf.ini files, error messages after upgrade
- many examples are without description

Note: the "COPYING" file was changed to be identical with the file
"LICENSE". The two differences are a new link to the FSF website,
and different notation for examples. In the terms&conditions part
not a single letter was changed.
