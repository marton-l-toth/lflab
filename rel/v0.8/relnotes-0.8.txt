lflab v0.8

quicktest.sh was run in the following environments:
(warning, the next 4 lines contain a lot of (registered) trademarks)
rel/v0.8/lflab-0.8-0-amd64.deb  : Debian 7 on Dell I17R, ALC283, MAYA44USB
rel/v0.8/lflab-0.8-0-i386.deb   : Linux Mint 17.3 (VirtualBox), PulseAudio
rel/v0.8/lflab-0.8-0.x86_64.rpm : openSUSE Leap 42.1 (VirtualBox), PulseAudio
rel/v0.8/lflab-0.8-0.i686.rpm   : Fedora 23 (VirtualBox), PulseAudio

Features:
- shadow wrap (indirect instruments, see help)
- plotting: avg/left/right selectable
- wrap: slider update config: right-click (old behaviour) / immediate
- trk: position indicator while playing; reverse cut (move: clipb->trk)
- faster startup/file load
- new help texts and examples

Fixes:
- gui config win. can now be opened for tracks
- auto suffix ".lf" for save files when filter is on
- linear finite-element system (=fe) geometry bug (see note(1))
- mixer mono/stereo bug (sqrt(2) multiplier, see note(2))
- label were wrong for some selector boxes
- wrap/grid config "sudden zero" bug
- wrap: invisible "=" (last column) bug
- crash when removing newly created #9 or #25 element in folder
- crash when wrap is deleted during playing/autovol calculation
- better recovery when gui/ioprc crashes
- fixed file ownership and some compatibility problems in .deb packages

Known problems:
- some options can only be set from command line ("save config" also saves these)
- there is no convenient way to delete a large number of objects

Notes:
(1) because the old (buggy) geometry also produced an audible sound,
    a "compatibility mode" is still available, open ".!b.filt.=fe" for help
(2) because the old behaviour was inconsistent, no "compatibility mode"
    is available here, some existing sounds/tracks may have changed, sorry
(3) on some Debian systems, you will get error messages for "gnuplot-x11":
    search for the package name/error message, it is a known bug (and not mine :))
