Note: the packages above (also the 32-bit ones) are built using SSE2.
Thus, it is possible to turn off denormal numbers (saving CPU time).
For old CPUs without SSE2 you have to compile it yourself, sorry.

Features:
- small speedup (unless compiled for old CPUs, see note above)
- configurable terminal (for console)
- examples (.!e.6 and .!e.1.[34] and new boxes)

Fixes:
- fixed dependency to libffi (removed, not directly using it...)
- io process does not stop when terminal unavailable
- disable locale (decimal commas were breaking graph display)
- time limit for 'hold' mode sounds on clipboards
- box/+/info1/used-by made more human-readable
- small GUI and help text corrections
