# lflab
audio lab with emphasis on linear filters
.
From primitive boxes (waves, impulses, noises, and linear filters --
various pole/zero based filters (Butterworth/Chebyshev, simple equalizer,
user-defined), echo (comb), finite-element (string/membrane) --
you can build more complex boxes (directed acyclic graph, with optional delayed
feedback), and finally wrap them in instrument configurations so that they can
be played on audio devices or written to WAV files. lflab comes with a simple
track editor, waves/freq.spectrum display (via gnuplot) and a few examples.
Currently available only on Linux.
