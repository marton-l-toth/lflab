# lflab
audio lab with emphasis on linear filters

From primitive boxes (waves, impulses, noises, and linear filters: 
various pole/zero based filters, echo (comb), finite-element (string/membrane)
you can build more complex boxes (directed acyclic graph, with optional delayed
feedback), and finally wrap them in instrument configurations so that they can
be played to an audio device or written to WAV files.

Currently works only on Linux.
